File 3 contains the Task 2: Sum of Integers from 1 to 50 Using a Loop. I used for loop in which i used range for int from 1 tp 51 and then and i used a var named sum to which i assigned value 0 and then asked it to add the numbers until it reaches 50.And finally printed the statement.
File 4 contains the Task 1: Check if a Number is Even or Odd. At first i asked for a number and used if statement which would print even if the remainder is 0 after dividing that number by 2, else print odd.
